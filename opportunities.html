							We're particularly interested in welcoming new students, visiting scientists, and postdocs with an interest in one or more of the following:<br /><br /><ul class="circle"><li>Large-scale reconstructions of past temperature and hydroclimate using tree-rings or other proxies</li><li>Paleoclimate data assimilation and the application of other advanced statistical techniques</li><li>Collecting and developing new tree-ring chronologies for reconstructions of temperature, precipitation, drought, snow, and ocean-atmosphere dynamics </li><li>Quantitative wood anatomy (QWA) </li><li>Research integrating climate data and paleoclimate reconstructions with historical, archaeological, and modern social science data to better understand the interactions and feedbacks between coupled human and natural systems in the past, present, and future</li><li>Tropical dendrochronology and recent tropical climate variability, particularly in Central America</li><li>Proxy systems modeling</li><li>Stable and radiogenic isotope dendrochronology, particularly focused on reconstructing ocean-atmospheric circulation, tropical climate variability, or providing precise chronology for important events in Earth's history</li><li>Paleoclimate dynamics using the combined power of paleoclimate proxies and models, including the connection between climate and ecological processes (productivity, fire, forest dynamics), understanding large-scale modes of climate variability, and using networks of proxies to understand past ocean-atmosphere variability. </li><li>Central American climate &mdash; past, present, and/or future &mdash; using methods from physical and/or social sciences</li></ul><br /><strong><u><br />May 2024</u></strong>: I am particularly interested in supporting postdocs or long-term visitors with experience and interest in quantitative wood anatomy.  At the LTRR we have established the facilities to perform all aspects of QWA research, so please get in touch if you would like to explore any opportunities. <br /><br />Potential graduate students and postdoctoral scientists are encouraged to <a href="people.html" title="People">contact current and previous members of the lab</a> to gain an independent perspective on academic life at the University of Arizona, living in Tucson and the southwest, and the style and history of mentorship and training in our lab. <br /><br />The US National Science Foundation (NSF) maintains a website that is a clearinghouse for various funding opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists here:<a href="https://new.nsf.gov/science-matters/nsf-101-graduate-postdoctoral-researcher-funding" target="_blank"> https://new.nsf.gov/science-matters/nsf-101-graduate-postdoctoral-researcher-funding</a><br /><br /><center><h3>Postdoctoral Scholar and Fellow Opportunities</h3></center><br />If you are interested in preparing <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/how-postdoctorates-apply" rel="external">NOAA</a>, <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3" rel="external">NSF</a>, <a href="https://npp.usra.edu/" rel="external">NASA</a>, or other postdoctoral fellowship applications to come to the University of Arizona, <strong>please contact me to discuss options and your plan for a research proposal</strong>.  Our lab welcomes postdoctoral scientists broadly interested in working on research questions related to any aspect of past, present, and future climate and environments as well as coupled natural-human systems and the dynamics of socio-environmental systems.<br /><br />The <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc" target="_blank">NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Program</a> provides an excellent opportunity for postdoctoral research (our somewhat outdated host description is <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc-host/kevin-anchukaitis" rel="external">here</a>). The deadline is typically very early in <strong>January</strong> every year.  Unlike the NSF opportunities below, the NOAA program is open to non-US citizens and non-permanent residents on a visa. <br /><br />If you have a Ph.D. in Geography (or <em>anticipate completing your Ph.D. in the coming year</em>) and you are a US citizen or permanent resident (a 'green card' holder), you may want to consider the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2018/nsf18584/nsf18584.htm" rel="external">Postdoctoral Fellowship Program at NSF SBE</a>.  The deadline is typically in <strong>November</strong>.  Please contact me if you're interested in submitting a proposal to join our lab and the School of Geography, Development, and Environment as a Postdoctoral Fellow. Note there are two possible tracks for SBE Postdoctoral Fellows: Fundamental Research in the SBE Sciences (SPRF-FR) or Broadening Participation in the SBE Sciences (SPRF-BP).<br /><br />If you have a Ph.D. in the Earth, Ocean, Atmospheric, or Environmental Sciences (and you are a US citizen or permanent resident),you may want to consider the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf19574" rel="external">Postdoctoral Fellowship Program from NSF AGS</a> (which has a <strong>rolling deadline</strong>) or the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144" rel="external">Postdoctoral Fellowship Program from NSF EAR</a> (which has a <strong>September deadline</strong>).  <br /><br />Postdoctoral Fellowships are also now available through a new call from <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505887&org=NSF&sel_org=NSF&from=fund" rel="external">NSF's Office of Polar Programs</a>. The deadline is each <strong>February</strong>.  If you'd like to join us to do work at high-latitude treelines or Arctic ecosystems, please consider this program and get in touch.  As with other NSF postdoctoral programs, you need to be US citizen or permanent resident at the time of the application.<br /><br /><center><h3>Visitors</h3></center><br />The Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research has the <a href="https://ltrr.arizona.edu/fellowships" target="_blank">Agnese N. Haury Visiting Scholar & Trainee Fellowship</a>, which provides limited funding to support visitors to the LTRR for several weeks to learn new skills in dendrochronology and collaborate with LTRR investigators.  In those years when the program is offered and there is sufficient funding, the deadline for applications is typically in the late <strong>spring</strong>.  For the 2025-2026 round of visits, the application deadline was May 15, 2024. <br />  <br /><center><h3>Graduate Student Opportunities</h3></center><br /><br /><strong><u>2024-2025</u></strong><strong>:</strong> I would like to admit one graduate student with a broad interest in paleoclimate reconstruction in the 2024-2025 admission cycle (beginning Fall 2025).  Please contact me if you'd be interested in applying. Please note that in your email, you should describe specifically (1) how your academic background and current scientific interests align with those of my laboratory, and (2) why specifically you would like to come to University of Arizona to work with me.  Students interested in using quantitative wood anatomy and/or paleoclimate data assimilation would have the highest priority for admission. <br /><br /><a href="people.html" title="People">Students in my lab</a> work in a range of research areas including multiproxy dendrochronology, spatiotemporal data analysis and data assimilation, coupled human-natural systems and the connection between climate change and human society, and paleoclimatology across a range of timescales and different proxy systems around the world.  What is most important is not the tools we use, but rather the questions we ask and the impacts they have for society. <br /><br />I encourage you to get in touch with me via email to discuss current openings. In your email, please be sure to describe specifically how your scientific interests align with those of my laboratory. <strong>  </strong>Potential Masters and Ph.D. students interested in coming to the University of Arizona for <a href="http://ltrr.arizona.edu/">dendrochronology</a>, paleoclimatology (especially high resolution paleoclimatology), <a href="http://geography.arizona.edu/">earth systems geography</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379113002011">proxy system modeling</a>, climate field reconstructions, climate model/data intercomparisons, and/or <a href="http://www.physics.arizona.edu/ams/">radiocarbon</a> are encouraged to contact me [<script>document.write("<a href='mailto:&#107;&#97;&#110;&#99;&#x68&#x75&#107;&#97;&#105;&#116;&#105;&#x73&#64;&#x65&#109;&#x61&#105;&#108;&#46;&#x61&#x72&#x69&#x7A&#111;&#110;&#x61&#x2E&#101;&#x64&#x75'>&#107;&#x61&#x6E&#99;&#104;&#x75&#x6B&#x61&#105;&#x74&#105;&#x73&#64;&#x65&#109;&#97;&#x69&#108;&#46;&#x61&#114;&#105;&#x7A&#111;&#110;&#x61&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;</a>");</script>] about potential opportunities.<br /><br />Graduate school application deadlines are in earliest January of each year for autumn admissions.
